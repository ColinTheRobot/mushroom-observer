MAPS:

"Thumbnail" maps are shown on the observation page.

Maps with lots and lots of observations and/or locations are now simplified to
reduce the stress on your browser.  In such cases, if you click on a pin, you
can ask it to map the subset of observations and/or locations in that area.
Let us know if you think we've over-simplified these maps.  (We limit it to 100
observations presently.) 



PROJECTS:

Observations, images and species lists can now belong to projects.  A
preliminary interface is ready for testing.  Note the checkboxes at the bottom
of the forms for creating and editing observations, images, and species lists. 

Attaching an observation, say, to a project gives all members of that project
the ability to edit your observation.  This is, then, a mechanism for giving
groups of users the ability to collaborate on entering data from forays,
herbaria, etc. 

To create a project, go to "List Projects" (from the left side of the page),
and look for "Add Project" at the top of the list of existing projects.  Users
can request to be added to a project by sending an "Admin Request" to that
project.

Please let us know what you think.
