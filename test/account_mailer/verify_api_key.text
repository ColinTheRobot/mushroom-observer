Hello rolf

The application "For testing purposes only." (associated with user "dick") has requested access to your Mushroom Observer account.  If you recognize this application and wish to give them permission to post observations, etc. in your name, all you have to do is click on the activation link below to activate the API key they just created.  Note that you can review your list of API keys at any time by visiting the API Key Manager from your "Preferences" page.

Activate Key: http://localhost:3000/account/activate_api_key/1
API Key Manager: http://localhost:3000/account/api_keys

To report a suspicious access request, just respond to this email.
